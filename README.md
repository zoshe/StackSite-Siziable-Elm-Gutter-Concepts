# stacksite-Siziable-Elm-Gutter-Concepts
<p>
 It's a concept for elements to have user Sizable Gutters. It's only a concept, but if U end up using any of my code please don't forget to note my code, or please feel free to donate to help me out with medical and project funding on my gofundme page once I get it up soon.

<b>Please Note</b> The code was written many years ago, and itâ€™s no longer viable or safe for todays uses. If time permitted with the grace of God, I plan to design it into a useful modern code that will be part of the StackSite code generator to help make websites and web-based apps more impairment and user friendly.
