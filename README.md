# stacksite-Siziable-Elm-Gutter-Concepts
<p>
 It's a concept for elements to have user-sizable gutters. It's only a concept, but if you end up using any of my code, please remember to give credit in your code to zoshe at www.zoshe.com . Alternatively, feel free to help out or sponsor the Zoshe Initiative platform.

<b>Please Note</b> The code was written many years ago, and itâ€™s no longer viable or safe for todays uses. If time permitted with the grace of God, I plan to design it into a useful modern code that will be part of future work.
